# Task Lists (shift checklists)

The Today/Tasks page groups a company's shift checklists into `TaskList`s (Opening Shift, Mid-Shift, Closing Shift, and any manager-created custom lists — see "Manager-created task lists" below), plus one or more standalone "anytime" task lists for anytime/recurring tasks — see [anytime-tasks.md](anytime-tasks.md). Each list contains an ordered list of `Task`s — a **placement**, see "Company Task Catalog" directly below — and each placement's status for a given date is tracked by a separate `TaskLog` document, so history is never overwritten — every day gets its own log per task, shared across the whole company (any employee on shift can complete a given task — see [task-lists-api.md](../api/task-lists-api.md)).

## Company Task Catalog

A `Task` is a list **placement** — a lightweight join connecting one of the company's saved checks into a specific `TaskList`, carrying only what varies per placement: `scheduledDays`, `successThreshold`, `order`, and an optional `projectedMinutes` override. The check itself — name, icon, `taskType`, `formFields`, and any NFC binding — lives one layer up, on `TaskDefinition` (the company's "Company Task Catalog"). The same `TaskDefinition` can be placed in more than one list: the fridge-temp check, say, placed in both the opening and closing lists, each getting its own independent `TaskLog` history and streak strip (different obligations at different times, even though it's "the same physical check").

This solves a real limitation of the earlier one-layer model: a check that legitimately happens more than once a day (fridge temp at opening, again at closing) used to require two entirely separate `Task` documents that happened to share a name — and scan-to-complete would have needed two separate physical tags stuck on the same fridge to match. Now the NFC binding lives on the shared `TaskDefinition`, so one tag works for every list the check is placed in.

- **`Task` deliberately keeps its name** — CLAUDE.md's product vocabulary already defines Task as "an individual item within" a TaskList, which is exactly what a placement is. `TaskLog.taskId`, the external API's `routineItemId`, and every streak/analytics computation key off the placement's `_id`, unchanged from before this split — nothing downstream of a `Task` API response changed shape either (see [task-lists-api.md](../api/task-lists-api.md)'s "Tasks & Task Definitions" section), only where name/icon/fields/NFC binding are actually stored.
- **Editing** a definition (name, icon, form fields) cascades to every list it's placed in — it's the same physical check, so this is intended, not a bug. **`projectedMinutes`**, in contrast, is edited per-placement as an override of the definition's default — a manager can give the same check a longer budget in one list without touching the others.
- **NFC binding** (`Scan to Link` — see [nfc.md](nfc.md)'s "In-app scan-to-complete binding") lives on the definition, not any one placement — bind it once and every list it's placed in inherits the same tag. A tag scanned via the FAB's "scan to open" shortcut (`GET /api/tasks/by-nfc-uid`) resolves to the definition first, then — since one binding can now back more than one placement — to whichever placement is "most relevant right now" via `lib/task-definitions.ts`'s `resolveMostRelevantPlacement`: skip anything already resolved today, prefer whichever list's `startTime` is closest to the current time, fall back to list/placement order. This is a documented judgment call, not a fully settled product spec.
- **Deleting** a placement (the trash icon in a list's edit view) only removes it from that one list — the definition, and any other list's placement of it, is untouched; it just drops back into the catalog with one fewer placement. **Deleting a definition entirely** (from "Company Task Catalog") is blocked while any active placement still references it — a manager has to remove it from every list first. Simplest option to build, and a deliberate choice over cascading the delete or leaving orphaned placements.

**Manager UI**: the catalog is the bottom "Company Task Catalog" section of the **Manage Tasks** screen (`/tasks/manage`, manager-only, see `components/ManageTasksView.tsx`) — reached from a manager-only gear icon in the Tasks page header (`components/Header.tsx`'s `showManageLink`) or from the Profile page. It lists the full catalog regardless of which lists currently use each entry, is where a definition gets deleted (or fails to, with a message naming which lists still use it), and — since this split moved NFC binding onto the definition — is also where "Scan to Link"/"Unbind" happens directly (`POST`/`DELETE /api/task-definitions/[id]/nfc-tag`), working even for a definition not yet placed in any list. The same screen's top section lists every scheduled `TaskList` (tap through to `components/TaskListEditView.tsx` to rename/reschedule/delete it or manage its tasks, same screen as before) and a "+ Add Task List" button; its middle section is a read-only overview of the anytime lists' tasks. From any list's edit page, "+ Use an existing task" (`components/AddExistingTaskSheet.tsx`) places an existing catalog entry into that list without creating a new definition — the original "+ Add task" flow (browsing `TaskTemplate`s or building custom) is unchanged and still always creates a brand-new definition.

## Task types

`TaskDefinition.taskType` (see "Company Task Catalog" below — task content, including `taskType`, lives on the definition, not the list placement) is one of:

- **`form`** — the only creatable type. Has a `formFields` array — `number` readings with an optional unit/min/max, `boolean` yes/no answers, `text`, or `checklist` (one or more to-do sub-items, given in `items`, that must all be checked to save; a single-item checklist renders as one big checkbox using the field's own `label`, multiple items render as their own rows grouped under it — see `models/TaskDefinition.ts`'s `FormFieldDef`); tapping it opens `components/TaskFormScreen.tsx` to fill in those fields, with elapsed time tracked the same way a timer would be.
- **`standard`** / **`stopwatch`** / **`checkbox`** — timer-based personal-habit item types from before the app's pivot to restaurant work checks. Kept in the schema for compatibility with old data; nothing in the UI creates them anymore.

## Log states (anytime tasks — `TaskCard`)

A `TaskLog` (see [task-lists-api.md](../api/task-lists-api.md)) has `state: "in_progress" | "paused" | "done" | "missed" | "rest"`, or simply has no log yet ("pending"). Neither `in_progress` nor `paused` counts as complete for a list's completion check.

The per-row action panel described below applies only to an **anytime task** (`TaskCard.tsx`, no `startTime` on its list — see [anytime-tasks.md](anytime-tasks.md)). A **shift-window task** (`TaskRow.tsx`, its list has a `startTime`) has no per-row actions at all — see "Task list locking & sequential-only completion" below.

- **pending** → tap opens the row and shows: Start Task (opens `TaskFormScreen` for a form task), or Missed/Rest buttons. If the list's scheduled window has passed ("back-entry" mode, see below), the start button is replaced by a Done button plus a manual minutes input (and, for a form task, the same field inputs).
- **in_progress** → shows "▶ Resume Timer" (reopens the timer, seeded with elapsed time from the server's `startedAt`) plus Missed/Undo. The API enforces that **at most one log can be `in_progress` at a time per person** (`performedByUserId`, not per company — different staff can each have their own timer running) — starting a timer elsewhere auto-*completes* whatever that same person left running instead of leaving two things active at once (see [timer.md](timer.md)).
- **paused** → same row treatment as `in_progress` ("▶ Resume Timer", reopening wherever it was left) — this state only ever arises from jumping to a different task inside an open Task List Session, never from anything on this row itself. Tapping "Resume Timer" on a paused task reopens the session at that task rather than a standalone timer, since a paused log always carries its session anchor. See [timer.md](timer.md) for the full pause/resume mechanics.
- **done** → shows an "Edit time" button that opens a manual start/end time editor, plus Missed/Rest/Undo.
- **missed** / **rest** → shows a retry action (Start Task, or Done+minutes if in back-entry mode) plus the other skip state and Undo.
- **Undo** (any logged state) calls `onStateChange(null)`, which `DELETE`s the log entirely — the task returns to pending. **Manager-only** — see "Manager-only Undo" below.
- **Manual time entry** ("Edit time" / "Log with specific times") lets the user type a start and end clock time directly; it computes minutes client-side and calls `onStateChange("done", { startedAt, completedAt })`, which bypasses the timer UI entirely and PATCHes explicit timestamps (see task-lists-api.md).

Implemented in `components/TaskCard.tsx` (`app/api/task-logs` is the log endpoint used by every action above — see [task-lists-api.md](../api/task-lists-api.md)).

## Time-aware collapse (today only)

Each shift-window list (except an anytime list, see [anytime-tasks.md](anytime-tasks.md)) has a `startTime` (`HH:MM`) and an implied end time, `deriveCollapseAfter`, computed as `startTime + sum(projectedMinutes of all non-checkbox tasks)` (`components/TaskListCard.tsx`). On today's view:

- **Before `startTime`** — collapsed, shown as "starts `HH:MM`".
- **Between `startTime` and the derived end time** — expanded by default.
- **After the derived end time** — collapsed by default, and tasks switch into **back-entry mode**: the timer-start action is replaced by a Done button with a manual minutes input, since the scheduled window has passed.
- Once every visible task in the list is `done`/`missed`/`rest`, the card auto-collapses to a summary view after a 600ms delay (today's view only).
- **Past dates** (via the date nav) always render expanded, unconditionally, so history is fully visible — the time-window logic above only applies when viewing today.

A custom list without a `startTime` never derives a collapse window and simply stays expanded/manually-toggleable.

## Day-of-week visibility

Every `Task` carries its own `scheduledDays` (0=Sun..6=Sat), and `lib/task-visibility.ts`'s `isTaskVisibleOn` gates whether it actually renders on the Tasks page for a given date — a task not scheduled for today's day-of-week is hidden entirely, not just dimmed. A `TaskList` also carries its own `scheduledDays`, purely as a **default that gets pushed down** onto every task in it (overwriting each task's own field) whenever a manager changes the list's schedule — see "List-level scheduling" below. This means a not-scheduled list's tasks disappear for the day as a direct consequence of that push-down, with no separate list-level visibility check needed; a task still shows despite its list being off that day only if it was individually re-edited afterward to include that day, since editing one task's own `scheduledDays` doesn't touch its siblings.

This is a deliberate simplification: `scheduledDays`-based hiding applies uniformly to every task, including ones that had a custom schedule before list-level scheduling existed — previously `scheduledDays` only affected the weekly analytics/streak dot, never whether a task actually appeared; now it does both.

## List-level scheduling

`PATCH /api/task-lists/[taskListId]` accepts a `scheduledDays` field (in `components/TaskListEditView.tsx`'s "Days scheduled" row). Saving it does two things in one request: updates the `TaskList.scheduledDays` field itself, and overwrites `scheduledDays` (clamping `successThreshold` down to fit, never up) on **every** `Task` currently in that list. This always overwrites, even a task a manager had previously customized independently on its own edit form — simplest option to build, and documented as a deliberate choice rather than an oversight: a task can still be reopened and re-customized afterward on top of the new default (a default-then-override relationship, not a hard lock), it just doesn't survive the *next* list-level schedule change.

## Streaks & variance

Each row shows `StreakDots` (`components/StreakDots.tsx`) — a dot strip built from `weekLogs`, one dot per day of the **fixed Sunday–Saturday calendar week** containing `today` (`lib/week-dates.ts`'s `calendarWeekDates`, computed once server-side in `app/(app)/tasks/page.tsx` and passed down as `weekDates`/`weekLogs`). This is a fixed frame, not a trailing "last 7 days" window — the dot for a given weekday always sits in the same position regardless of what day it currently is. `StreakDots` has no day-letter labels at all, unlike the Analytics chart (see `analytics.md`) — deliberately a lighter-weight treatment since this strip repeats on every row — but the dot for whichever date is currently being viewed (`viewingDate` — `selectedDate` from the date nav, `today` when nothing's been navigated) still gets a small gold ring around it so it's identifiable without one. Browsing to a past date via the date nav moves this ring to that date's dot instead of leaving it on today's — e.g. viewing a Sunday highlights the first (leftmost) dot in the strip. `viewingDate` is deliberately a separate prop from `today`: which days are `pending` in the weekly-progress math (below) always stays anchored to the real date, never to whatever's being browsed. For timed tasks marked done, the row also shows the variance between `actualMinutes` and `projectedMinutes` (e.g. `+8m` in an "over" color, `-3m` in an "under" color).

"This week" is Sunday–Saturday specifically, by design — a fixed calendar-week frame, not a trailing 7-day window.

### Weekly schedule + success threshold

Every `Task` carries `scheduledDays` (0=Sun..6=Sat, which days it's expected — default every day, and see "List-level scheduling" above for how a manager sets this for a whole list at once) and `successThreshold` (how many of this week's *scheduled* days need to be `done`/`rest` to read as 100%, default = the number of scheduled days). Both are set/edited via the schedule row and threshold input in the task's inline edit form (`components/TaskListEditView.tsx`'s `SortableRow`, reached through "⚙ Manage" — see "Reordering & editing task lists" below) or at creation time in `AddTaskSheet`'s custom-task form.

The shared math lives in `lib/task-progress.ts`'s `computeWeeklyProgress` (imported by both `StreakDots` and the Analytics Task Breakdown, see `analytics.md`, so the two never diverge). Each of the week's 7 days classifies into one of six states — the first two are solid fills ("something happened"), the rest are hollow, no-fill outlines distinguished by border color/style ("needs a look"), deliberately so a close-but-different fill color is never the only thing telling two states apart:

- **`done`** — logged done that day (solid fill); counts toward `successCount` regardless of how the color reads — going over time is still a win against the threshold, it just renders differently, see "Timing color" below
- **`rest`** — an intentional skip (solid blue-muted fill) — counts toward `successCount` exactly like `done`, never rendered as a fail state
- **`missed`** — an explicit Missed tap (hollow, solid red/burgundy-light border, ✕ mark where there's room) — deliberately distinct from `unlogged` below even though both are equally "not a success" for the math
- **`unlogged`** — a strictly-past scheduled day with no log at all (hollow, solid grey/dim border, no mark) — a read-time interpretation only, nothing is ever written to the database to represent it
- **`pending`** — a scheduled day that's today (and not yet resolved) or later this week (hollow, **dashed** grey/dim border — the dash is what separates it from `unlogged`'s solid border)
- **`not_scheduled`** — a day outside `scheduledDays` entirely (very faint solid fill, no border) — excluded from every count above; a log that happens to exist on a non-scheduled day (e.g. logged anyway) is invisible to this math, not a bonus. As of "Day-of-week visibility" above, this state now also means the task is hidden from the Today view that day, not just dimmed in the streak strip.

### Timing color (done days only)

A `done` day is also colored by how close `actualMinutes` came to the task's target (`projectedMinutes`) — a display-only tier, computed by the same `computeWeeklyProgress` (its `timing` field), that never affects `successCount`/`percentage`/pacing above. Only two tiers, deliberately:

- **green** (olive) — at or under target (`actualMinutes / projectedMinutes <= 1`)
- **amber** — over target by any amount, however severe — there's no third "way over" tier

**Red is reserved exclusively for `missed`** — no other day state, solid or hollow, ever renders red. Overtime, no matter how extreme, stays amber; severity within "overtime" is deliberately not surfaced as a separate color.

Only applies to tasks with a real time target — a form task's fields aren't timed against a target the same way, so this tiering is mostly a legacy concern from the pre-pivot timer types.

The resulting percentage (`successCount / successThreshold * 100`) is **uncapped** — hitting the threshold with days to spare stays a win past 100%, it doesn't clamp back down. A three-state, non-gradient **pacing** verdict — `green` (threshold already reached), `red` (mathematically out of reach even with a perfect rest of the week: `successCount + remainingScheduled < successThreshold`), `amber` (still achievable, everything else) — drives the Analytics Task Breakdown's bar/badge (`StreakDots` itself doesn't surface pacing, only the per-day dots).

## Manager-created task lists

Any signed-in manager (`User.role === "manager"`) can create a new task list from the Manage Tasks screen's "+ Add Task List" button (`components/AddTaskListSheet.tsx`, `components/ManageTasksView.tsx` — this button lived on the Tasks page itself before task-list management was consolidated onto this dedicated screen) — name and optional start time (blank = an anytime list that never collapses), then straight into `AddTaskSheet` to build out its tasks, the exact same browse-catalog-or-build-custom flow used everywhere else. `POST /api/task-lists` is manager-gated server-side too (`403` for an employee), same as rename (`PATCH`) and delete (`DELETE`) below — see [task-lists-api.md](../api/task-lists-api.md).

**Display order is `startTime`, not `TaskList.order`**: every query that lists a company's task lists in order (`app/(app)/tasks/page.tsx`, `app/(app)/tasks/manage/page.tsx`, `app/api/task-lists/route.ts`'s `GET`, `app/api/analytics/route.ts`) sorts `{ startTime: 1, order: 1 }` — a 1:00 PM list always sits between the 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM ones regardless of when it was created, and moving a list's position is just a side effect of editing its `startTime` (see "Editing, renaming, and deleting task lists" below), not a separate reorder step. `order` only breaks ties between lists sharing the same `startTime` — which is exactly what makes a freshly duplicated list (see "Duplicating a list" below) land immediately after the list it was copied from: it's created with the same `startTime` as its source but a strictly higher `order` (same "append at the end" convention every new list uses — see `POST /api/task-lists` and `.../duplicate` below). Anytime lists (`startTime: null`) sort before every timed list under this key, but `TasksView.tsx`/`ManageTasksView.tsx` both split them into their own section immediately regardless, so their position in this raw sort never reaches the screen.

**Duplicating a list**: a small copy icon next to each list on the Manage Tasks screen's Task Lists section calls `POST /api/task-lists/[taskListId]/duplicate` (manager-only), which copies the list itself (name suffixed `" (Copy)"`, same `timeOfDay`/`startTime`/`scheduledDays`) and every one of its active task placements, appended at the end of the company's list order. Each copied placement points at the SAME `TaskDefinition` as its source (`definitionId` is copied, not duplicated) — duplicating a list reuses the company's existing saved checks under a new schedule rather than forking a second, independent copy of each one, which would silently split its `TaskLog` history/streak and NFC binding away from the original. Only the placement-level fields (`scheduledDays`, `successThreshold`, `projectedMinutes` override, `order`) are copied per task. The new list opens the same way any manager-created list does — reachable from the Task Lists section to rename or reschedule afterward.

## Editing, renaming, and deleting task lists

- `components/TaskListEditView.tsx` (`app/(app)/tasks/[taskListId]/edit/page.tsx`) — dedicated per-list edit page: a drag-to-reorder task list, each task's inline edit form (name, icon, fields, schedule/threshold — see `TaskFieldsEditor.tsx`), the "Add task" sheet, and the list's own name/`startTime`/`scheduledDays`. Also displays each list's and task's raw Mongo `_id` read-only (`select-all`, no copy button) — these are the ids the [external API](../api/external-api.md) needs to target a specific timer. Its per-task inline edit form (`SortableRow`) is also where a task's own `scheduledDays`/`successThreshold` (see "Weekly schedule + success threshold" above) get edited after creation — a day-of-week toggle row plus a threshold input, clamped client-side to never exceed the number of selected days.
- Deleting a task is a **soft delete** (`isActive: false`, via `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]`) — history in `TaskLog` is preserved even after a task is removed from the active list.
- **Renaming a list, changing its schedule, or deleting it** are all manager-only actions on this page — see "Manager-created task lists" above. Deleting a list is also a **soft delete** (`TaskList.isActive: false`, via `DELETE /api/task-lists/[taskListId]`) — its `TaskLog`/`TaskListSession` history is untouched, it just drops off the active Tasks page.

## The "Start Tasks" sequential session

Tapping "Start Tasks"/"Continue Tasks" on a list (not shown for an anytime list) opens `components/TaskListSessionView.tsx`, which steps through that list's tasks one at a time in a single full-screen flow rather than expanding rows individually. Each task gets its own server-side `in_progress` record as it becomes current, and closing the session mid-task flushes that task's progress rather than discarding it — full mechanics in [timer.md](timer.md).

## Task list locking & sequential-only completion

A shift-window list's tasks (any list with a `startTime` — Opening/Mid/Closing/a manager-created custom list with one set) can only move forward through that list's own "Start Tasks"/"Continue Tasks" session, one person at a time. An anytime list (see [anytime-tasks.md](anytime-tasks.md)) is unaffected by everything in this section.

### Shift-list rows are view-only

`TaskRow.tsx` has no Start/Missed/Rest/Edit-time actions at all — tapping a row only expands it to show its current state and, for a `form` task already `done`, the captured field readings (`TaskLog.formData`, threaded down through `TasksView`/`app/(app)/tasks/page.tsx`). The only way to *move a shift-list task forward* is that list's own session. The one exception is Undo, which stays available as a manager-only escape hatch (`canUndo`/`onUndo` props, same gating as `TaskCard.tsx` — see "Manager-only Undo" below) — a mistake in an already-logged entry still needs to be correctable even though the row otherwise can't be touched directly.

This is enforced server-side too, not just by removing the buttons — `lib/task-log-actions.ts`'s `assertShiftListSessionAuthorized(companyId, taskId, sessionTaskListId)` rejects (`403`) any `POST`/`PATCH` to `/api/task-logs` for a shift-list task unless `sessionTaskListId` (a fresh request's own param when starting a timer, or the log's already-carried-over `sessionTaskListId` for a terminal write) matches that task's own `taskListId`. The per-task `in_progress` start `TaskListSessionView.tsx` fires the moment a task becomes current stamps that anchor before Done/Missed/Rest ever becomes reachable, so anything that actually came through the session is authorized; a direct call bypassing it has nothing to match and is rejected. An anytime task is never restricted (its list has no `startTime`).

### Session lock — one person at a time

`TaskListSession.performedByUserId` (see [timer.md](timer.md)) doubles as a lock on that list's open (`in_progress`) session:

- **No open session, or the open session is yours** → the "Start Tasks"/"Continue Tasks" button (`TaskListCard.tsx`) behaves as before, tappable.
- **Open session, held by someone else** → the button becomes a non-tappable **"In progress by `<name>`"** label.
- **Same, viewed by a manager** → same label, plus a small **unlock icon** next to it. Tapping it shows an inline confirm ("Remove `<name>` from this task list so someone else can continue?"); confirming calls `POST /api/task-lists/[taskListId]/unlock-session` (manager-gated, `403` for an employee), which clears `performedByUserId` back to `null` on the *existing* session via `lib/task-list-session-actions.ts`'s `unlockSession` — nothing is closed, duplicated, or reassigned, and already-completed tasks in it stay exactly as they are.

An unlocked session (`performedByUserId: null`) behaves exactly like a brand-new one for claiming purposes: `ensureOpenSession` claims it for whoever next starts a task in that list, the same mechanism that stamps it on a session's first-ever touch. `GET /api/task-lists/session-locks?date=<date>` (polled by `TasksView.tsx` alongside logs) reports which of the company's shift-window lists currently have a *claimed* lock — an unlocked session reports no lock at all.

**A FAB scan is a fourth way to start or join a shift-window list's session**, alongside tapping "Start Tasks"/"Continue Tasks" or resuming a paused task — see [nfc.md](nfc.md)'s "FAB 'scan to open' shortcut". It opens the exact same `TaskListSessionView` guided walkthrough the other three do, landed on the one physically-scanned task's own row (free-jump from there, same as any other open session) rather than list position zero — mechanically equivalent to tapping "Start Tasks" and then tapping straight to that row. It is permanently tied to exactly one task, though: a *terminal* log on that task (`done`/`missed`/`rest`) is a dead end — rescanning never reopens or advances it, only reports its status — but rescanning the tag while that task is still `in_progress`/`paused` inside an open session it can access jumps back to the same row, never spawning a second start. It's subject to the same lock as the other three: `lib/task-list-session-actions.ts`'s `resolveFabScanTarget` checks `getOpenSessionLocks` before answering, so a scan that lands on a list someone else already holds surfaces the same "In progress by `<name>`" state instead of silently joining, whether the scan is a fresh one or a rescan.

### Manager-only Undo

`DELETE /api/task-logs` (Undo — deletes a `TaskLog` entirely, returning a task to pending) is manager-only server-side (`403` for an employee), **everywhere** — anytime tasks included, no exceptions and no "same person, same moment" carve-out. An employee who logs a wrong value asks a manager to undo it rather than fixing it themselves. `TaskCard.tsx`'s three Undo buttons (done/missed/rest) are gated client-side the same way (`canUndo={userRole === "manager"}`, threaded down from `TaskListCard.tsx`).
