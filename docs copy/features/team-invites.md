# Team & Invites

A **Team** tab in the bottom nav where every company member can see the roster, and a way for managers to add new users to the company **without any full-user-directory search**. Joining is invite-token-only: a manager generates a link, shares it out-of-band (text/email/AirDrop/OS share sheet), and opening that link is what attaches a person to the company. Nothing about company assignment is ever client-supplied — it's always resolved server-side from the token.

This mirrors the existing `/nfc/[tagCode]` pattern (public, unauthenticated deep link → forced sign-in with `callbackUrl` preserved → server-side claim) rather than inventing a new auth flow — see [`features/nfc.md`](nfc.md).

## Why token-based, not directory search

Ch'rps is multi-tenant — a manager searching "the full user catalog" would mean browsing every Ch'rps user across every company, a privacy leak with no product upside. An invite token scopes the join action to exactly the company and role the manager intended, and is the only thing that authorizes it.

## Data model

Collection: `invites` (`models/Invite.ts`):

```ts
Invite {
  companyId,
  token: string,             // crypto.randomBytes(24).toString("base64url") — unguessable, never derivable from the Invite's own _id
  role: "employee" | "manager",   // preset by the manager at creation time; applied to the User on redemption
  createdByUserId,           // attribution only, same pattern as NfcTag.claimedByUserId
  createdAt,
  expiresAt: Date,           // default now + 7 days
  maxUses: number (default 1),    // 1 for "this one new hire"; the Invite sheet's "Reusable link" toggle sets 50 instead (a generous but non-infinite cap, not a real limit anyone's expected to hit — see components/InviteSheet.tsx's REUSABLE_MAX_USES)
  useCount: number (default 0),
  revokedAt: Date | null,
}
```

Indexes: `{ token: 1 }` (unique), `{ companyId: 1, revokedAt: 1 }` (for the manager's pending-invites list).

`models/User.ts` gained one field: `companyJoinedAt: Date | null`, set alongside `companyId`/`role` at redemption time — distinct from the adapter-owned account-creation timestamp, so re-joining a *different* company later reflects current tenure there, not original account creation. Null for anyone hand-attached to a company directly in MongoDB rather than through an invite (every pre-existing user).

`User.role`'s enum was widened to also allow `null` — the state `DELETE /api/team/[userId]` leaves a removed teammate in, alongside `companyId: null`, "not yet attached to any company," same as a brand-new sign-up. This is safe because every company-scoped route already gates on `companyId` being non-null before ever reading `role` (see `lib/session.ts`'s `resolveSessionUser()`); a null role never grants access on its own, it just avoids a stale role value surviving a company detach.

## Redemption flow — "share a link, then open it"

1. Manager taps **+ Invite** on the Team tab → picks a role and one-time-vs-reusable → `POST /api/invites` (manager-only) creates the `Invite`, returns `{ token, url }` where `url` is `<request origin>/invite/<token>` — the origin is read off the incoming request (`new URL(req.url).origin`), not a hardcoded domain constant, so it's correct in production, on a Vercel preview deploy, and in local dev alike.
2. `components/InviteSheet.tsx` shares that URL via the Web Share API (`navigator.share`) where available — no native Capacitor plugin needed, it works inside the app's WKWebView on iOS — falling back silently to a visible Copy Link button everywhere else (desktop browsers, etc).
3. Recipient opens it. `/invite/[token]` is **not** in `middleware.ts`'s `PUBLIC_PAGE_PATHS`, so a logged-out tap redirects to `/login?callbackUrl=/invite/<token>` — `app/login/page.tsx` already reads `callbackUrl` generically, same as the NFC flow.
4. `app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` (server component) looks up the `Invite` and validates, in order:
   - Not found, `revokedAt` set, `expiresAt` passed, or `useCount >= maxUses` → renders a generic "This invite is no longer valid" message. Doesn't distinguish *why* — no useful info for the recipient, and avoids leaking internal state to whoever holds the link.
   - Signed-in `User.companyId` is non-null **and different** from `invite.companyId` → blocks with "You're already part of a team — contact support to switch companies." Never silently reassigns a user who already belongs somewhere.
   - Signed-in `User.companyId` already equals `invite.companyId` → treated as idempotent success (double-tap, refresh) — redirects straight to `/tasks`, no double-increment.
   - Otherwise → redeems: atomically `findOneAndUpdate({ token, revokedAt: null, expiresAt: { $gt: now }, $expr: { $lt: ["$useCount", "$maxUses"] } }, { $inc: { useCount: 1 } })`. If that update matches nothing (lost a race to another simultaneous redemption against a `maxUses: 1` link), falls back to the "no longer valid" message rather than a 500. On success, sets `User.companyId`/`role`/`companyJoinedAt`, redirects to `/welcome` (the existing splash screen — see `app/welcome/page.tsx`, unchanged).

The atomic increment-with-filter is what keeps a `maxUses: 1` link from being redeemed twice by two people who open it at the same moment — same spirit as the single-active-timer invariant elsewhere in this app, just applied to invite consumption instead of task logs.

## API

Auth follows the existing pattern throughout: `lib/session.ts`'s `resolveSessionUser()`, `SKIP_AUTH`-gated dev fallback, `401` otherwise. `companyId`/`role` read fresh from the `User` document on every call, never trusted from the client.

### `POST /api/invites`
**Manager-only** (`403` for an employee). Body: `{ role: "employee" | "manager", maxUses?: number, expiresInDays?: number }` — `400` if `role` is missing or not one of the two values. Defaults: `maxUses: 1`, `expiresInDays: 7`. Response: `{ _id, token, url, role, maxUses, expiresAt }`.

### `GET /api/invites`
**Manager-only**. This company's non-revoked invites, newest first: `{ _id, role, maxUses, useCount, expiresAt, createdAt, createdByName }`. Excludes `revokedAt: { $ne: null }` entirely — a revoked invite just disappears from this list, no "revoked" state ever shown.

### `DELETE /api/invites/[id]`
**Manager-only**. Sets `revokedAt: new Date()` — `404` if not found or not this company's. Soft-delete, not a hard remove, so a redemption already in flight still fails cleanly against the revoked state rather than a missing document.

### `GET /api/team`
**Any signed-in company member** (not manager-gated — this is the read-only roster everyone sees). Every `User` with this `companyId`: `{ _id, name, image, role, joinedAt }`, managers first then alphabetical by name. `joinedAt` is `companyJoinedAt ?? createdAt` (falls back for anyone attached before this feature existed). `image` is returned but not currently rendered anywhere — the Team tab uses the same initials-only avatar convention as `Header.tsx`/`ProfileView.tsx`, kept for design consistency rather than introducing photo rendering as a one-off.

### `PATCH /api/team/[userId]`
**Manager-only**. Body: `{ role: "employee" | "manager" }` — `404` if not found or not this company's member. **Guard**: `400` if this would demote the company's last remaining manager (`User.countDocuments({ companyId, role: "manager" })` checked first) — a company with zero managers is a lockout state nobody can recover from through the UI.

### `DELETE /api/team/[userId]`
**Manager-only**. `$set: { companyId: null, role: null, companyJoinedAt: null }` — the same "not yet attached" state a brand-new sign-in sees (`components/NoCompanyMessage.tsx`). Soft company-detach, not an account deletion — historical `TaskLog`s etc. stay scoped to the company they belonged to at the time. Same last-manager guard as `PATCH` above.

## Team tab UI

`components/BottomNav.tsx`'s bottom nav grew from Tasks | FAB | Analytics (renamed to Reports, see [reports.md](reports.md)) to **four tabs, two per side**: Tasks, Team | FAB | Reports, and a 4th slot after Reports that's an inert placeholder (`MoreHorizontal` icon, non-interactive, not a `Link`) reserved for a future tab — added purely to keep both sides visually balanced rather than leaving Team lopsided alone on the left. Profile stays exactly where it already was: the avatar icon in the top nav (`Header.tsx`), not a bottom-nav tab — this was a deliberate choice when the tab was added, not an oversight.

`app/(app)/team/page.tsx` + `components/TeamView.tsx`:

- **Roster** (everyone): rows from `GET /api/team` — initials avatar, name (current user tagged "(you)"), joined date, role badge. Read-only for an employee; tapping a row for a manager opens `components/TeamMemberActionSheet.tsx`.
- **Pending Invites** (managers only, below the roster): rows from `GET /api/invites` — role badge, uses-remaining, expiry, creator name, a **Revoke** button per row (`DELETE /api/invites/[id]`).
- **+ Invite** button (managers only): opens `components/InviteSheet.tsx` — pick role, pick "Just this person" vs "Reusable link", tap Generate → `POST /api/invites` → Web Share API (falls back to a visible Copy Link button).
- **`TeamMemberActionSheet.tsx`** (managers only): "Make Manager"/"Make Employee" (single toggle button, since there are only two roles) and "Remove from team" (`window.confirm()` first — same destructive-confirmation convention `TaskListEditView.tsx`'s delete-list button already uses, not a custom multi-step confirmation UI). Both actions disable, with an inline explanation, rather than round-tripping to the API and failing, whenever this row is the company's last remaining manager (computed client-side from the already-fetched roster's manager count) — this applies to *any* row that would trip the guard, including the acting manager's own, not specifically "your own row" in general.

## Open questions / deferred

- Whether an invite can be scoped to a specific email address (locking redemption to that Google account) rather than "whoever has the link" — not in this first pass; every invite here is link-possession-based, same trust model as the NFC tag links.
- Whether employees should see *who* invited whom, or only the current roster — current implementation keeps the roster minimal (name/role/joined) and puts inviter attribution only in the manager-only Pending Invites list.
- ~~Whether removing a user from a company should also revoke their `apiKey`~~ — moot now: `User.apiKey` and the entire external API surface it authenticated were removed outright (see `docs/project-structure.md`'s note on the removal), so there's no longer a lingering key to worry about revoking on team removal.

## Depends on

[`api/task-lists-api.md`](../api/task-lists-api.md) and [`features/nfc.md`](nfc.md) for the established auth/session-resolution and public-deep-link patterns this feature reuses.
