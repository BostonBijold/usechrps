# Reports

Renamed from "Analytics" — a real-world label managers and employees recognize. `app/(app)/reports/page.tsx` → `ReportsView` → `ReportsContent` (`components/ReportsContent.tsx`, `"use client"`), a thin segmented-control dispatcher over two sub-tabs: **Overview** (chart-based trends, split by role below) and **Logs** (a chronological history, new — see "Logs tab" below). Both are backed by `GET /api/reports` (`app/api/reports/route.ts`, renamed from `/api/analytics`) and, for Logs, the new `GET /api/task-logs/history` (`app/api/task-logs/history/route.ts`).

These live inside the Reports page itself, **not** a new bottom-nav slot — the nav's 4th placeholder (see [team-invites.md](team-invites.md)'s "Team tab UI" section) is untouched.

## Role split

- **Managers** see the company-wide dashboard that existed before this split, unchanged.
- **Employees** see a personal-only view scoped to their own logs — a way to review their own work, not the whole team's.

`app/api/reports/route.ts` branches on `resolveSessionUser().role`: when `role === "employee"`, the `TaskLog` query gets an extra `performedByUserId: session.userId` filter. Every downstream aggregate (`taskListStats`, `taskStats`, `weeklyProgress`) folds over that filtered log set without touching `performedByUserId` itself, so this one filter personalizes the whole response automatically — no per-field special-casing needed. `TaskList.find({companyId})` and `Task.find({companyId, isActive:true})` stay unscoped by user in both branches — they're the shared catalog (what's expected), not activity (who did it).

One consequence worth knowing: `taskListStats[].totalTasks`/`totalProjectedMins` stay **company-wide catalog counts** even for an employee — a list with 5 tasks still shows `totalTasks: 5` even if this employee personally only logs 2 of them because of shift patterns (Task has no assignee concept — any employee can complete any task, see `models/Task.ts`). The denominator is "the schedule," matching `computeWeeklyProgress`'s existing philosophy, not a new special case. This means an employee's completion % can legitimately reflect a teammate's shift-shared task, not something they personally missed.

Role gates this outright for v1 — a manager always gets company-wide, an employee always gets self-only; there's no "view my own numbers" opt-in for a manager who also works shifts.

## Overview tab

### Manager — the pre-split dashboard, unchanged

`components/reports/ManagerOverview.tsx`. Two windows, both computed server-side by `getDates(days, anchorDate)`:

- **7-day** — a **fixed Sunday–Saturday calendar week** containing `anchorDate` (`lib/week-dates.ts`'s `calendarWeekDates`, the same helper `StreakDots` uses — see [task-lists.md](task-lists.md#streaks--variance)). This can include dates *after* `anchorDate` (later this week) — the client renders those as a distinct pending state rather than pretending they're "no data" days. The frame is always 7 slots wide regardless of what day of the week `anchorDate` is.
- **30-day** — a trailing window of the 30 days ending at `anchorDate`. By construction this never contains a future date, so none of the pending-state logic below ever applies to it.

`anchorDate` is the client's local date (`?localDate=`, computed client-side via `toLocaleDateString("en-CA")`) — never derived from server UTC. The response echoes it back as `today`.

**Denominators exclude days that haven't happened yet**: per-day breakdowns (`daily`) always include every date in the window, including future ones, for a consistent chart width. Aggregate denominators (`tasks[].totalDays`, `tasks[].unloggedCount`) are computed over `elapsedDates` (`dates.filter(d => d <= anchorDate)`) instead.

**Rendering**: `components/reports/TaskListChart.tsx` renders each task list's `daily` array as a bar chart, with a dashed hollow placeholder for future dates and a bolded gold today-marker when `showLabels` (7-day view only). `components/reports/TaskStatRow.tsx` (renamed from the old inline `TaskRow` inside `AnalyticsContent.tsx` — **not** `components/TaskRow.tsx`, the Tasks page's own per-day row) renders, for the 7-day view, a schedule-aware 7-segment day strip + pacing badge via `lib/task-progress.ts`'s `computeWeeklyProgress` (see [task-lists.md](task-lists.md#weekly-schedule--success-threshold)); the 30-day view falls back to a flat completion-rate bar.

### Employee — personal, new

`components/reports/EmployeeOverview.tsx`. Fetches the identical `/api/reports` endpoint (already personalized server-side by the role split above) and renders, top to bottom:

1. **Summary strip** — three at-a-glance stats in a single card:
   - **Current streak** — see "Current streak" below.
   - **This week's completion rate** — a single %, aggregated across every task's own `weeklyProgress.successCount`/`successThreshold` (only meaningful in the 7-day view — hidden in the 30-day view, since a weekly threshold has no clean meaning against a trailing 30-day window).
   - **Tasks logged today** — a count of this person's tasks with a `done` state on `today`.
2. **Charts, scoped to self** — the exact same `TaskListChart`/`TaskStatRow` components the manager view uses, reused as-is, fed the already-personalized data. No employee-specific chart code exists — only the summary strip above is new UI.

### Current streak

No numeric "current streak" existed anywhere in this codebase before this feature — only `StreakDots`' 7-dot weekly visual and `computeWeeklyProgress`'s weekly %. `lib/streak.ts` adds one, computed employee-only (bundled into `/api/reports`'s response as `currentStreak`, `undefined` for a manager):

- Walking backward from `today` (or from **yesterday** if today still has an unresolved scheduled task — an in-progress day shouldn't prematurely break the streak), a day counts toward the streak if **every one of the company's active tasks scheduled on that weekday** has a `done` or `rest` log from this specific person.
- A day with zero scheduled tasks is skipped over — it neither extends nor breaks the streak.
- The streak ends at the first fully-in-the-past day with a missed or unlogged scheduled task, or after `maxLookbackDays` (default 365).
- Deliberately checks the **full active task catalog**, not "tasks this person has personally ever logged" — same "denominator is the schedule, not who logged it" philosophy as the role split above. This means an employee's streak can legitimately break because a teammate left a shift-shared task unlogged, not something the employee themselves missed — a known, accepted quirk, not a bug.
- `computeCurrentStreak` (pure, unit-testable) does the walk; `computeCurrentStreakForUser` (DB-fetching wrapper) resolves the "today or yesterday" start date and fetches a bounded window of this person's `TaskLog`s.
- Supported by a new index on `models/TaskLog.ts`: `{ companyId: 1, performedByUserId: 1, date: 1 }` — neither pre-existing index covered `performedByUserId`.

## Logs tab

A flat, chronological, filterable history — the audit-trail / "verifiable proof" view, most recent first. New: `GET /api/task-logs/history` (`app/api/task-logs/history/route.ts`), rendered by `components/reports/LogsTab.tsx`.

This is a **separate route from `GET /api/task-logs`**, not an extension of it — that existing route only supports a single `date` param and returns the whole company's logs for that one day (built for "what happened today" screens: the FAB, `TasksView`, `TaskListSessionView`, all of which depend on its current simple contract). The new route is a date-**range**, paginated, denormalized query built for history browsing.

**Query params**: `startDate`, `endDate` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, both required — no unbounded "all time" query; 400 if `startDate > endDate`); `userId?` (manager-only); `taskListId?`; `page?` (default 1), `limit?` (default 30, capped at 100).

**Scoping** (`resolveSessionUser()`, never trusted from the client):
- Employee → always forced to `performedByUserId: session.userId`, regardless of any `userId` the client sends.
- Manager + `userId` given → that one teammate's logs.
- Manager + no `userId` → **no** `performedByUserId` filter at all — company-wide, every employee's logs. This is the default, matching the manager Overview's own company-wide default.

`taskListId` filtering resolves to a `taskId` set first (`Task.find({companyId, taskListId}, "_id")`) since `TaskLog` has no `taskListId` of its own — same join-direction pattern `/api/reports` already uses for its per-list start-time attribution.

**Sort**: `{ date: -1, completedAt: -1, startedAt: -1, createdAt: -1 }` — grouping by day first, then falling through completedAt/startedAt/createdAt as tiebreakers, gives "most recent first" including logs with no `completedAt` (missed/rest) without needing a computed sort key.

**Denormalization**: three batch queries regardless of page size — `Task` (joined through `resolveTasks` for name/icon/taskType), `TaskList` (for `taskListName`), `User` (for `performedByName`, skipping any non-ObjectId id such as `SKIP_AUTH`'s dev sentinel).

**Response**:
```ts
{
  logs: Array<{
    _id, date, state, actualMinutes, completedAt, startedAt,
    taskId, taskName, taskIcon, taskType, taskListId, taskListName,
    performedByUserId, performedByName, note, isBackEntry,
  }>;
  page, limit, hasMore, totalCount,
}
```

**Pagination**: simple page/limit with a `hasMore` boolean — no cursor. This is the first paginated route in the codebase; cursor pagination on a sometimes-null `completedAt` field wasn't worth the added complexity at current data scale.

**UI** (`components/reports/LogsTab.tsx`): manager gets a team-member `<select>` (from `GET /api/team`, "All team members" default) and a task-list `<select>` (from `GET /api/task-lists`, "All lists" default), plus two date inputs defaulting to a trailing 14-day window; employee gets the same minus the team-member dropdown and the per-row performer name (always "you"). "Load more" appends the next page; no infinite-scroll observer (no such pattern exists elsewhere in this app either).

Deferred: exact retention/paging limits for very old date ranges, and a CSV/export option — neither scoped for v1.

## Data shape (`GET /api/reports?days=7|30&localDate=YYYY-MM-DD`)

```ts
{
  dates: string[];   // all dates in the window, oldest → newest
  days: number;
  today: string;     // == localDate, echoed back
  taskLists: Array<{ _id, name, totalTasks, daily: DailyStat[], avgCompletionRate, avgActualMins, totalProjectedMins, avgStartMinutesUtc, startTimeSampleSize }>;
  tasks: Array<{
    _id, name, icon, taskListId, taskListName, projectedMinutes, daily,
    doneCount, missedCount, restCount, unloggedCount, avgActualMins, avgVariance,
    completionRate, engagedDays, totalDays, taskType,
    weeklyProgress?: WeeklyProgress; // only when days === 7 — see lib/task-progress.ts
  }>;
  currentStreak?: number; // employee-only — see "Current streak" above; absent for a manager
}
```

`avgStartMinutesUtc` is a task list's average earliest `startedAt` across days it was logged (personal-only for an employee, once role-scoped), still in UTC minutes-since-midnight — the client (`utcMinsToLocalTime`) converts using the browser's own timezone offset, the same UTC-storage/local-display split used throughout the timer system (see [timer.md](timer.md)).

## Depends on

[`api/task-lists-api.md`](../api/task-lists-api.md) for the `TaskLog` states this all aggregates over, and the `scheduledDays`/`successThreshold` fields on `Task`. [`team-invites.md`](team-invites.md) for the bottom-nav layout this feature doesn't modify, and `GET /api/team` (used by the Logs tab's team-member filter).
